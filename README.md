# Stat-290-Project
Stat 290: Computing for Data Science

Initial brainstorming: 

Design and build an R package to compare results from traditional‚Äù machine learning tool (for instance boosting) and comparing it with the results of the state-of-the-art deep learning framework with R interface (for instance H2O or Keras/TensorFlow using the `keras` package or PyTorch using the `reticulate` package (Python integration in R)).
