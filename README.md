# Stat-290-Project
Stat 290: Computing for Data Science

## Team:
* Sagar Ganapananeni
* Vikramjeet Singh


## Initial brainstorming: 
### Idea 1:
Design and build an R package to compare results from traditional‚Äù machine learning tool (for instance boosting) and comparing it with the results of the state-of-the-art deep learning framework with R interface (for instance H2O or Keras/TensorFlow using the `keras` package or PyTorch using the `reticulate` package (Python integration in R)).

### Idea 2:
Design and build an R package that would help in
* Identifying the data types and necessary conversion based on the actual data type.
* Detecting anomalies/outliers 
* Imputing missing values (dealing with NAs)
* Basic transformations of data (applying log transformation, binning a continuous variable)
* Plotting distribution of features before and after applying transformations. 

### idea 3: 
Weather data project
